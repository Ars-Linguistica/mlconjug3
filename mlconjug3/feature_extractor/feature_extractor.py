    | Custom Vectorizer optimized for extracting verbs features.
    | As in Indo-European languages verbs are inflected by adding a morphological suffix,
     the vectorizer extracts verb endings and produces a vector representation of the verb with binary features.
    | To enhance the results of the feature extration, several other features have been included:
    | The features are the verb's ending n-grams, starting n-grams, length of the verb, number of vowels,
     number of consonants and the ratio of vowels over consonants.
