Stable release
--------------

To install MLConjug3, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install mlconjug3

This is the preferred method to install MLConjug, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.


You can also install mlconjug3 by using Anaconda_ or Miniconda_ instead of `pip`_ .

To install Anaconda_ or Miniconda_, please follow the installation instructions on their respective websites.
After having installed Anaconda_ or Miniconda_, run these commands in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda config --set channel_priority strict
    $ conda install mlconjug3

If you already have Anaconda_ or Miniconda_ available on your system, just type this in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c conda-forge mlconjug3

.. warning::
    If you intend to install mlconjug3 on a Apple Macbook with an Apple M1 processor,
    it is advised that you install mlconjug3 by using the conda installation method as all dependencies will be pre-compiled.
