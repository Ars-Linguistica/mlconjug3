=========
mlconjug3
=========

A Command Line application and Python library to conjugate verbs in French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian (more soon) using Machine Learning techniques.

- Conjugate any verb in one of the supported languages, even completely new or made-up verbs, with the help of a pre-trained Machine Learning model.
- The pre-trained models are composed of a binary feature extractor, a feature selector using Linear Support Vector Classification, and a classifier using Stochastic Gradient Descent.
- Easily modify and retrain the models using any compatible classifiers from scikit-learn.
- Uses Verbiste as the training data for the French model, and unsupervised learning techniques to generate the data for the English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian models.

Installation
------------

To install mlconjug3, you have multiple options:

- Using pip: 
  This is the preferred method to install mlconjug3, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 
  To install mlconjug3, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install mlconjug3


If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide you through the process.

- Using pipx_ (recommended for users who want to avoid conflicts with other Python packages):

.. code-block:: console

  $ pipx install mlconjug3


- Using conda:
  You can also install mlconjug3 by using Anaconda_ or Miniconda_ instead of `pip`.
  To install Anaconda or Miniconda, please follow the installation instructions on their respective websites.
  After having installed Anaconda or Miniconda, run these commands in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
  $ conda config --set channel_priority strict
  $ conda install mlconjug3
  
If you already have Anaconda or Miniconda available on your system, just type this in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda install -c conda-forge mlconjug3

.. warning::
  If you intend to install mlconjug3 on a Apple Macbook with an Apple M1 or M2 processor or newer,
  it is advised that you install mlconjug3 by using the conda installation method as all dependencies will be pre-compiled.
