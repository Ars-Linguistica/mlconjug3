| A Python library to conjugate verbs in French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian (more soon)
    using Machine Learning techniques.
| Any verb in one of the supported language can be conjugated, as the module contains a Machine Learning model of how the verbs behave.
| Even completely new or made-up verbs can be successfully conjugated in this manner.
| The supplied pre-trained models are composed of:

- a binary feature extractor,
- a feature selector using Linear Support Vector Classification,
- a classifier using Stochastic Gradient Descent.

| MLConjug uses scikit-learn to implement the Machine Learning algorithms.
| Users of the library can use any compatible classifiers from scikit-learn to modify and retrain the models.

| The training data for the french model is based on Verbiste https://perso.b2b2c.ca/~sarrazip/dev/verbiste.html .
| The training data for English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian was generated using unsupervised learning techniques
  using the French model as a model to query during the training.
