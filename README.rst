A Python library to conjugate verbs of Many languages using Machine Learning techniques.
Any verb in one of the supported language can be conjugated as the module contains a Machine Learning model of how the verbs behave.
Even completely new or made-up verbs can be successfully conjugated in this manner.
The supplied pre-trained models are composed of:

- a binary feature extractor,
- a feature selector using Linear Support Vector Classification,
- a classifier using Stochastic Gradient Descent.

MLConjug uses scikit-learn to implement the Machine Learning algorithms.
Users of the library can use any compatible classifiers from scikit-learn to modify and retrain the model.

The training data is based on Verbiste https://perso.b2b2c.ca/~sarrazip/dev/verbiste.html .
