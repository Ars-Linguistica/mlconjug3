=======================================
mlconjug3: The multi-lingual conjugator
=======================================

A Command Line application and Python library to conjugate verbs in French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian (with more languages soon to come) using Machine Learning techniques. üß†

The mlconjug3 project is now a proud member of the ARS Linguistica organization. ü§ù ARS Linguistica is a community-driven, open source project that aims to develop free and accessible linguistic tools and resources for all. üåç With a focus on advancing linguistic research, documentation, and education, ARS Linguistica is dedicated to preserving and promoting linguistic diversity through the use of open source and open science. üí°

With mlconjug3, you can:

- Conjugate any verb in one of the supported languages, even completely new or made-up verbs, with the help of a pre-trained Machine Learning model. üí™
- Easily modify and retrain the models using any compatible classifiers from scikit-learn. üîß
- Integrate mlconjug3 in your own projects. üß¨


Using mlconjug3 in Academic Research
------------------------------------

mlconjug3 is a valuable tool for linguistic researchers, as it provides accurate and up-to-date conjugation information for a wide range of languages. üß™ With its ability to handle completely new or made-up verbs, mlconjug3 is perfect for exploring new linguistic concepts and theories. üîç It can also be used to compare and contrast conjugation patterns across different languages, helping researchers to identify and understand linguistic trends.

Integrating mlconjug3 in Applications
-------------------------------------

In addition to academic research, mlconjug3 can be integrated into a wide range of web and desktop applications. üíª For language learning platforms, mlconjug3 provides an accurate and comprehensive source of conjugation information, helping students to quickly and easily master verb conjugation. üìö For language translation tools, mlconjug3 can help to ensure that translations are grammatically correct, by providing accurate verb conjugation information in real-time. üí¨

By using mlconjug3, you are not only getting a powerful and flexible tool for verb conjugation, but you are also supporting the goals and mission of ARS Linguistica. üôå Whether you are a linguistic researcher, language teacher, or simply someone who is passionate about preserving linguistic heritage, your support is crucial to the success of our organization. 

Join us in our mission to make linguistic tools and resources accessible to all! üí™

Installation
------------

To install mlconjug3, you have multiple options:

- Using pip: 
  This is the preferred method to install mlconjug3, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 
  To install mlconjug3, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install mlconjug3


If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide you through the process.

- Using pipx_ (recommended for users who want to avoid conflicts with other Python packages):

.. code-block:: console

  $ pipx install mlconjug3


- Using conda:
  You can also install mlconjug3 by using Anaconda_ or Miniconda_ instead of `pip`.
  To install Anaconda or Miniconda, please follow the installation instructions on their respective websites.
  After having installed Anaconda or Miniconda, run these commands in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
  $ conda config --set channel_priority strict
  $ conda install mlconjug3
  
If you already have Anaconda or Miniconda available on your system, just type this in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda install -c conda-forge mlconjug3

.. warning::
  If you intend to install mlconjug3 on a Apple Macbook with an Apple M1 or M2 processor or newer,
  it is advised that you install mlconjug3 by using the conda installation method as all dependencies will be pre-compiled.
